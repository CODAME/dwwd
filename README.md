# Setup Instructions #

- Get a [Gimbal Beacon](http://gimbal.com/), set it up in their [web portal](https://manager.gimbal.com/)
- Make a new applicaiton in the [web portal](https://manager.gimbal.com/), paste the API key into `FullscreenActivity.java`
- Install the app on 4 android devices 
- Set each device to a different location (tundra, sands, space, ocean) by tapping the `Change location` button
- Place the devices within 50 meters of each other

# Gameplay Instructions #

- The goal is to deliver drugs from one location to the next (without crashing).
- Illicit transactions are accomplished by hovering the drone near a location for a few seconds.
- After each successful transaction, the player is prompted with their next delivery destination. 
- Piloting with a purpose for ~~hours~~ decades of fun!

# Inspiration #

- Flying drones around the same room/office/house starts to loose itâ€™s appeal.
- Create a game with simple goals to keep same-room flight interesting.
- Teaches basic pilot skills like controlled hovering.
- Rewards advanced pilot skills like quickly punching to points of interest.
- Social component: since each location requires a phone, friends get together to set up a play field and compare runs.
